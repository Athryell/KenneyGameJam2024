BUGS
- [ ] GAMEPLAY - Meteor particles are super small after conversion to CPU
- [ ] GAMEPLAY - When attracted by a Black Hole and teleport
		to other side of the screen the gravity keeps pulling,
		mybe need to reset in when teleported?
- [x] GAMEPLAY - When There are more than 3 ore more twins it's possible
		to connect the first to the second and back to the first
		to complete the route. Should disable the once olready connected 
		or keep a list of the once already touched (maybe with this solution
		is easier to reactivate them?)
- [x] PERFORMANCES - Big stutter on first load of each particle, it happens onli on
		compatibility which is required for web build => Change all particles from GPU
		to CPU and apparently it works
- [ ] PERFORMANCES - Change Black Hole particle system from GPU to CPU
