BUGS
- [ ] When attracted by a Black Hole and teleport
		to other side of the screen the gravity keeps pulling,
		mybe need to reset in when teleported?
- [ ] When There are more than 3 ore more twins it's possible
		to connect the first to the second and back to the first

		or keep a list of the once already touched (maybe with this solution
		is easier to reactivate them?)
